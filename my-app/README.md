Reflection

This is a project for testing my skills and knowledge of react, CSS, JSX and UI designs. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding JSX, CSS and rest of the code.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
